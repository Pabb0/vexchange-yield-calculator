# Vexchange Yield Calculator

Starting project to get some practice with the Vexchange SDK.

This project tracks the APY of the following tokens (in an LP with VET):
  - VeThor Token
  - OceanEx
  - Safe Haven
  - VIMworld
  - VPunks Token

## How to run for the first time
- Add your info to [initial JSON file](info.json)
  - For every token you can set the amount of LP tokens you have (check [Vexchange](vexchange.io) for this) (or just leave it at 1000 if you just want to see the APY)
  - For every token you need to set the start date (day, month and year)
- Run the following commands in the terminal
  - npm install
  - npm run-script first
  - npm run-script run

## Next runs
- npm run-script run
